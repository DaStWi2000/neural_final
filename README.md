Final Project for Neural Signals

To start using the project, run the 'initialize' script. In this file, specify what the path of the extracted database is.

Code for reading EDFs into MAT files come from:
Imtiaz, S.A.; Rodriguez-Villegas, E., "An Open-source Toolbox For Standardized Use Of PhysioNet Sleep EDF Expanded Database," in Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC), 2015 37th Annual International Conference of the IEEE, 2015
Vidaurre, Carmen, Tilmann H. Sander, and Alois Schl√∂gl. "BioSig: the free and open source software library for biomedical signal processing." Computational intelligence and neuroscience 2011 (2011).

Database comes from:
